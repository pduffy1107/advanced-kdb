In order to change schema for the trade table, one must follow these steps:

1) Shut down the Tickerplant and RDB/RTS processes.

2) Edit trade table definition in the sym.q file to include a new column "seqNum" with datatype long.
	trade:([] time:"n"$(); sym:`$(); px:"f"$(); sz:"j"$(); seqNum:"j"$());

3) Create a new TPLOG file naming standard OR edit the currently existing TPLOGs to include the new column name.

4) Use the dbmaint.q tool from code.kx.com to add a new column to our partitioned schema. The addcol function will add a new column to disk partitioned table and enumerate the column if required.

5) Make any necessary changes to Real-time subscribers (e.g. possibly the CEP process).

6) Restart the Ticker Plant and RDB processes. The RDB initialises from the Tickerplant so any changes made to sym.q will be picked up by the Real-time subscribers.
